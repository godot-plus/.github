## godot-plus
Non-official fork of Godot Engine 3 to allow testing of new features / improvements / bug fixes.

### Description
I'm intending to try and keep this fork compatible and up to date with the main repository, but also offer and test improvements that may be seen as risky in the main branch.

Please report issues / bugs specific to this fork in the _godot-plus_ issues. General bugs / issues should be reported as usual in the _godotengine_ organization.

## Overall
The fork should be compatible with vanilla Godot, and run / load faster in the Editor / projects, and compile 3x faster in DEV unity builds.

## Enhancements

### Core
* Robust normalize() - https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/74983
* Deferred NOTIFICATION_MOVED_IN_PARENT - https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/74672
* Eliminate collision checks between geometry in rendering - https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/72511
* Faster scene loading (approx 2x) - https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/70254
* Cache scenes during duplication - https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/70107
* Surface tool efficiency improvements (3x or more faster) - https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/69723

### Audio
* Add ability to mute AudioServer. Editor turns off audio CPU use unless actively playing sound. - https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/63458

### Rendering
* Batching - MultiRect command (2x faster 2D in bottleneck scenes) - https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/68960
* Canvas item hierarchical culling (up to 16000x faster when 2D items are off screen) - https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/68738
* Fix Polygon2D skinned bounds (for culling) - https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/75612

### Build
* Optional unity build (3x faster compilation) - https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/69405

Add `use_scu=yes` to your `Scons` command line to get faster compilation.
