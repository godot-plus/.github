## godot-plus
Non-official fork of Godot Engine 3 to allow testing of new features / improvements / bug fixes.

### Description
I'm intending to try and keep this fork compatible and up to date with the main repository, but also offer and test improvements that may be seen as risky in the main branch.

Please report issues / bugs specific to this fork in the _godot-plus_ issues. General bugs / issues should be reported as usual in the _godotengine_ organization.

The fork should be compatible with vanilla Godot, and run / load faster in the Editor / projects, and compile 3x faster in DEV unity builds.

#### Downloads
Select the godot-plus repository, and click the releases tab.

### License
godot-plus is MIT licensed, and shares the same license as godot engine.
